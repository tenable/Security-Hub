# Tenable Vulnerability Management to AWS Transformer

| :exclamation: | If upgrading from v1 please read the upgrade section |
| ------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |

This tool is designed to consume Tenable.io asset and vulnerability data,
transform that data into the AWS Security Hub Finding format, and then upload
the resulting data into AWS Security Hub.

The tool can be run as either a one-shot docker container or as a command-line
tool. To run as a docker image, you'll need to build the image and then pass
the config file to the container.

## Requirements

- The Tenable Vulnerability Management Integration for Security Hub must be
  configured to accept findings from the integration.
- At a minimum the configuration file must have the account id that the events
  will be sent to. Ideally the region should be configured as well.
- A set of API Keys within TVM should be configured to allow exportation of
  assets and vulnerability findings from the platform. These keys should be
  wither configured within the configuration file or as environment variables

## Installation

```
pip install tenable_aws_sechub
```

## Upgrading from v1

If you are upgrading from the original version of the integration, please note
that there are some additional steps that need to be taken as the ARN that is
used has changed.

1. Disable the Tenable.io SecurityHub integration
2. Enable the Tenable Vulnerability Management integration
3. Configure and run the updated integration (this code)

## Configuration

Simply build a configuration file (or use the [example file][cfg] provided)
with the following details:

```toml
access_key = "1234567890abcdef1234567890"
secret_key = "1234567890abcdef1234567890"

[[aws_profile]]
name = "default"
accounts = [1234567890]
region = "us-east-1"
```

Once the configuration file is saved, go ahead and ensure that the AWS CLI can
communicate to AWS, or generate the appropriate configuration parameters that
AWS needs for their boto3 client. Details for how to do this is documented
below:

1. [Boto3 Configuration](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration)
2. [AWS CLI Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

## Running the integration

```
❯ tvm2aws --configfile /path/to/config.toml
```

## Commandline options

```
❯ tvm2aws --help

 Usage: tvm2aws [OPTIONS]
